This is the RedfishService  for RedDrum 

The RedDrum resources are created by instantiating RfServiceRoot() in serviceRoot.py

The flask service is started by calling rfApi_RedDrum() in redfishURIs.py
  usage: rfApi_RedDrum(rfr, rdm, host="127.0.0.1", port=5001)
  where rfr is the rootData instance and rdm is the backend root instance.

This is a Flask app that runs untreaded, and uses the builtin httpd to serve http requests.
Use a front-end reverse proxy to proxy http and https to the flask service.

Redfish Session Auth and Basic Auth is supported with the Redfish authorization/permission model.
