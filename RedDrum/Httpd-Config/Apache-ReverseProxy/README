--Apache-ReverseProxy
    -- This is the httpd config used by the current BullRed-Rackmanager
    -- Apache has a virtualHost for http and https
    -- Apache handles all ssl and http processing and REVERSE PROXIES all /redfish/v1[/] traffic 
       to the builtin httpd inside the RedfishService   (Flask if RedfishService=FlaskApp)
    -- two conf files:  httpd.conf and ssl.conf
    -- see the ./sslCerts/README_howto_create_certs file for description re how to generate the ssl certs
    -- a bash script is here to show example requirement for disabling SElinux bouls and generating certs
    -- the reverse proxy also generates a couple of headers to tell the RedfishService whether the request
       originated on http or https
    -- performance measured on Rackmanager is awesome---letting Apache handle ssl is nice
       --Apache is running the ssl processing and socket handling multi-threaded and managing worker threads
         to talk to the Flask RedfishService
       --even though the Flask app is single threaded, a lot of the processing is thus done multi-threaded,
         and performance for multithreaded clients is faster
