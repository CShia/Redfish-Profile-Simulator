This is the Backend RedDrum implementation for the Simulator backend

The Simulator currently  has minimal backend processing:
  1) to translate Actions (eg power-off) into the appropriaate property statechanges in Chassis and System PowerState
     *** this not yet implemented
     *** so it currently does't reflect power changes when you poweron or poweroff

The Simulator relies of choosing a static resource discovery config under the RedfishService 
    -- that effectively "discovers" the Simlator resources from predefined static files 
       the files are essentially file copies of the database Cache that the RedfishSerivce keeps when it wants to start
       and reload its old resource cache instead of re-discovering everything.
    -- so RedfishSerivce is just configured to restart from cache, and default to a pre-defined cache if no cache exists.
       This is handy tool for test and for running as a simulator

    -- we might move these default caches out to the backend, but for now, they are inide RedfishSerivce.
    -- The backend CAN select WHICH static resource files to load from by changing RootData (rdr) variables
       because the Backend is initialized before RedfishService
    -- Therefore backendRoot, will set the required rfd properties to enable restartFromStatic Cache and setup the
       proper static cache
****** The platform setting for the cashed init data is "OcpFeatureProfile1"
